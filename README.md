# Dynamic and Stochastic Models
This repository contains projects from my dynamic stochastic modeling course (and a few from other classes that had cool math). 
Most of these projects attempt to accurately represent the randomness present in real world predictive tasks with the aim developing sound strategies in the face of uncertain outcomes. 

## Projects
The repository consists of the following projects:

1. **Optimal Advertising Strategy**

Utilized Markov processes to find a firm's optimal advertising strategy given current sales numbers.

2. **Asset Pricing**

Used a felicity function and dicount factor to derive the price of a simple security, 
reflecting diminishing returns to consumption and a consumer's preference for current consumption.

3. **Categorizing Time Series**

Plotted time series autocorrelations to classify them as autoregressive, moving average, or random processes, employing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
to estimate underlying parameters. A potential extension of this project would be writing a script that can classify and recreate an arbitrary time series.

4. **Effect of Smoking on Infant Birthweight**

Trained MLE models to predict the effect of a mother's smoking on infant birthweight 
given datasets with various innacuracies, such as only recording weights above 2500 grams.

5. **Probability of Recession**

Modelled Federal Reserve weekly economic index data as a time series, using Markov processes to 
simulate future economic trends, and determine the likelihood of a recession as severe as that
seen in Covid.
